/// The on-disk format of each block is shown below.

/// ```text
/// ┌─────────────────────┬───────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────────┐
/// │  Encrypted payload  │  Gap  │  Length  │  PreMac  │  CurrMac │   IV    │

///
/// Each block begins with encrypted user payload. The size of payload
/// must be smaller than that of block size as each block ends with a footer
/// (in plaintext).
/// The footer consists of fours parts: the length of the payload (in bytes),
/// the MAC of the previous block, the MAC of the current block, the IV used
/// for encrypting the current block.
/// The MAC of a block protects the encrypted payload, its length, and the MAC
/// of the previous block.
///

/// Each block is encrypted using this key and a randomly-generated IV.
/// This setup ensures the confidentiality of payload and even the same payloads
/// result in different ciphertexts.
///

/// not only stores its own MAC, but also the MAC of its previous block.
/// This effectively forms a "chain" (much like a blockchain),
/// ensuring the orderness and consecutiveness of the sequence of blocks.
///
/// Due to this chain structure, the integrity of a `CryptoChain` can be ensured
/// by verifying the MAC of the last block. Once the integrity of the last block
/// is verified, the integrity of all previous blocks can also be verified.
